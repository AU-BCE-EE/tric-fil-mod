# Running demo
In a console, browse to the latest subdirectory in `demos` and enter:

```
python3 demo.py
```

Note that earlier demos used earlier versions of the model, and so will generally not work with the latest version.
However, the local versions (originally copied into the subdirectories by each version of `demo.py`) would work.
